## About

XMAN is a ridiculous RPG game that is entirely run in the command line, and it features an economy, a turn-based combat system, a leveling system, a shop, and a working 2D board. What makes XMAN unique is that the game only uses the os and time libraries, which makes it lightweight and easy to run on most systems. Random library is used for generating the probability for successful attacks, making combat more exciting and unpredictable. Overall, XMAN is a well-crafted RPG game that proves that sometimes, less is indeed more.
